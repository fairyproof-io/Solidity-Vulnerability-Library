# Typical Vulnerabilities in Solidity Implementation

## Introduction

This is a codebase which covers typical vulnerabilities uncovered in Ethereum smart contract based Dapps.A code sample, unit test code, a typical case and recommendations are listed for each of the vulnerabilities. It is an assistant for users to learn these vulnerabilities' behavior and characteristics, help users uncover these vulnerabilities in code review and audit, and mitigate these vulnerabilities in smart contract development.
